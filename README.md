Simple Django Blog Application

This project is a beginner-friendly blog application built with the Django web framework. It serves as a practical, hands-on exercise for developers who have completed the official Django tutorial and want to solidify their understanding of core concepts like the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture, the Django ORM, and user authentication.

Features Implemented

As of the current version, the application supports the following features:

User Account Creation: New users can create an account through a public-facing registration page.

Secure User Login: Registered users can log in to access protected content.

Protected Content: The main blog post index and detail pages are only accessible to authenticated users.

Blog Post Display:

Logged-in users can view a list of the most recent blog posts.

Users can click on any post title to view its full content on a dedicated detail page.

Admin Post Management: A superuser can create, read, update, and delete blog posts using the built-in Django admin interface.

Backend: Python 3, Django

Database: SQLite 3 (Default for development)

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3
